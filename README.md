# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

-	Related "Challenge" GitHub Folders: Weather_Database, Vacation_Search, Vacation_Itinerary
-	Other folders were used for practice during class exercises.


### Purpose

The purpose of this week’s assignment was to explore “Application Programming Interfaces” (APIs) by using them to pull current weather and location data from cities around the world for the purpose of developing a vacation itinerary.


### Data Analyzed

Data pulled from APIs included:
-	Location and Weather data from the Open Weather Map 
-	Location, Hotel, and Driving Directions data from Google Maps


### Deliverables
The deliverables for this assignment were:

1)	Retrieve weather data: Latitude and longitude, Maximum temperature, Percent humidity, Percent cloudiness, Wind speed, and Current weather description (for example, clouds, fog, light rain, clear sky)
2)	Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map for hotels within 5000 meters of cities from my Deliverable 1 data that had temperatures between 65-90 degree Fahrenheit.
3)	Create a Travel Itinerary Map that showed a roundtrip road trip between four cities in the same country.

## Summary
As an avid traveler, I thoroughly enjoyed this challenge.  In all my travels, I have been to all seven continents and have visited 35 different countries.  That being said, there is still plenty to explore.  For Deliverable 3, I chose India for my vacation itinerary because I have not been to India (but I hope to go there someday.)
